# Environment variable utility functions for shell scripts.

#######################################
# Safely source an environment file into the current shell, exporting
# every variable it defines.
#
# Sourcing executes arbitrary shell code, so as a guardrail this only
# accepts files whose final path component starts with ".env" (for
# example ".env", ".env.example", ...); anything after the
# ".env" prefix is allowed. The path is sourced exactly as provided --
# it is not rewritten, resolved, or relocated. A missing file is not an
# error: the caller simply proceeds with its defaults.
#
# Example sourcing with environment variable, .env fallback and .env.example as final fallback:
# ```bash
#   ENV_FILE_LOCATION="$(resolve_env_file "${ENV_FILE:-}" "${SCRIPT_DIR}/.env" "${SCRIPT_DIR}/.env.example")"
#   source_env_file "${ENV_FILE_LOCATION}"
# ```
#
# Globals:
#   LOG_PREFIX
# Arguments:
#   $1: Path to the environment file to source.
# Outputs:
#   Writes status messages to STDOUT (via log); writes misuse messages
#   to STDERR (via error).
# Returns:
#   0 if the file was sourced, or was absent and defaults are used.
#   Exits 1 (via error) if no path is supplied, or the final path
#   component does not start with ".env".
